Client: Jeff Perlot, Instructor, Green River College (Kent, WA)

Team Agility, consisting of four students - Bessy Torres-Miller, Jen Shin, Quentin Guenther, and Kianna Dyck worked with Jeff to design an interactive marketing tool for his class. Jeff is an instructor at Green River College who instructs marketing students. This app is for Jeff and his students who need to generate ideas, create storyboards, present their product pitch, and vote for the best idea. Prior to this tool, Jeffâ€™s students wrote ideas on paper and voted through excel; this led to inconsistent results and extra work. With this app students now have one central tool to use for collaboration.
